# MoveExcelTableToWordDoc
This is a vba-Programm which uses a Macro to transfer the data from an Excel Table to an Word Document where it appends the data to an table.

Just insert your Table into the Excel-Document and press start. After a few second te Programm should be done. 

The Code basically just copies the needed columns, pastes them into word, and edits the table in word so it fits in with the design Guidelines of the company I'm woring at.
